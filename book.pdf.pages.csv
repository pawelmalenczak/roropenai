About Daniel Priestley

What Next?",78
Page 11,"“Few people have done more to inspire an entrepreneur
revolution and give entrepreneurs the tools and advice

they need to grow their businesses in recent years than
Dan. What I love about what he says and what he writes
is that it all comes from a deep personal experience of
bootstrapping a successful global small business himself
from little more than a maxed out credit card.”

who have gone before them. Daniel’s book is a brilliant
resource to help entrepreneurs ‘find their place’ and live

the ‘entrepreneur revolution dream’.”
